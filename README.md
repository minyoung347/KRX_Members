### Abstract

The investment decisions based on a similar information make herding in the financial market. In this paper, we study the herding and characteristics of member firms in the Korea Exchange. The member firms intermediate between the market participants and the exchange, and all participants should trade stocks through the members. In the Korea exchange, interestingly, the member firms do herding in the opposite direction of price change. To find out why the member firms do herding in the opposite direction, we examine the dynamics of members. Since a number of the heterogeneous investors trade the stocks through the same member firm, it is hard to identify the characteristics of the member firms. We deal with this issue by comparing with the inventory variation of individuals, institutions and foreigners. We categorize the members into three groups such as the domestic members similar to individuals, the domestic members similar to institutions and the foreign members. The trading characteristics of each group of members are revealed through the directionality and trending. While the foreign members tend to trade one-way and move with price change, the domestic members similar to individuals is the opposite. The network analysis shows the relationship between members using the correlation of inventory variation, and the community detection reveals that the members are clustered into three groups. Finally, the random matrix theory and the cross-sectional regression show that the inventory variation of members has significant information about the stock prices and herding of members helps pricing the stocks.
